# Optical Flow With RAFT

RAFT (Recurrent All Pairs Field Transform) is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed specifically for optical flow estimation. Optical flow is the task of estimating the apparent motion of image points between two consecutive frames of a video sequence. RAFT has achieved impressive results on various optical flow benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in this challenging task.
